<h1 id="jmess">jMess</h1>
<p>A simple event driven messaging framework for javascript.</p>
<h2 id="eventregistry">EventRegistry</h2>
<p>This is the heart of the system, it allows you to raise and hook to events while passing messages through your system.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-typescript">hook(eventName: string, onRaise: Function): () =&gt; void
</code></pre>
<p>will register a delegate to be invoked upon raising the event and then return a cancelation function that can be called to remove the hook that was just registered.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-typescript">raise(eventToRaise: string, data: Object): void
</code></pre>
<p>will raise an event passing the expected data along to each of the delegates registered to the event.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-typescript">register(eventsToRegister: string/Object/string[]): void
</code></pre>
<p>allows you to register events, although this step may seem unnecessary i have found it very useful in diagnosing typos in event names.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-typescript">getAvailableEvents(): string[]
</code></pre>
<p>allows you to see all currently registered events, this is mostly used for diagnostics.</p>
<h2 id="eventbarker">EventBarker</h2>
<p>A little logging tool to allow for a console log stream of the events passing through the system.  Simply tell it to</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">startBarking()
</code></pre>
<h2 id="lifecycleevents">LifeCycleEvents</h2>
<p>These events give you access points to have logic run across all commands at different points in the life cycle.</p>
<h2 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h2>
<h3 id="section">3.0</h3>
<p>This we have removed the dependency on underscore, this has a few effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are now using <code>Array.prototype.map()</code>, <code>Array.prototype.indexOf</code>, and <code>Object.keys</code>.  Consult <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5">Can I Use, ES5</a> for compatibility</li>
<li>You can now choose how you reference underscore, should you choose too.</li>
<li>Removes a heafty dependency in simple scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our project is written in typescript but compiled to target ECMAScript v5.</li>
<li>Currently depends on Underscore.js for some utilities with a terse syntax, as needed the project can be migrated off of it.</li>
<li>Uses the ILogR interface for logging.  Check out my ILogR project for an implementation with some jazz :D</li>
</ul>
